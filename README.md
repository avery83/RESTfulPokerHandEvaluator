# RESTfulPokerHandEvaluator API

### Problem Statement
I wanted to learn a more about REST web services so I decided to turn part of another project into a API. 
I had a partially finished Texas Hold Em game that had a seven card had evaluator that I was really proud of.  I decided to use that class to create a RESTful Web Service to get the score and best five hand card from any seven cards.
